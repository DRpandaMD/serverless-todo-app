`amplify init`

### After Configuring and Initialization

Your project has been successfully initialized and connected to the cloud!

#### Some next steps:
- "amplify status" will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
- "amplify <category> add" will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
- "amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
- "amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

#### Pro tip:
Try "amplify add api" to create a backend API and then "amplify publish" to deploy everything


## Common Amplify Commands

- add hosting \
`amplify hosting add`

- build app frontend and backend resources and provision them in the cloud \
`amplify publish`

- buid app backend resources and provision them in the cloud \
`amplify push`

#### Resolve easy problems
